# My-Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio showcases projects that I've worked on and completed along my developer journey. I am currently learning and using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I created this as a way to track my progress as a developer and to have as a way to show employers what I have worked on. With my projects in one place, it creates ease of access and makes it easy to refer to or send to others.

Making this portfolio taught me how to use things such as pseudo elements and flex containers and it also allowed me to be creative in choosing colors, fonts, sizing, images, etc.
